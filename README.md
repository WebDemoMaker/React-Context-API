### CONTEXT API

# use createContext for creating a context (Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components)

# use useContext hook for consuming the state(It is an alternative to context.Consumer)

## use useReducer for accessing the updated state and dispatching an action

<!-- Lets start with ContextAPI now -->
